**AutoTranspilation** folder consists of the source code files that are transpiled using C2Rust, CRust and Cp2SRust along with the generated target Rust files. <br><br>
**manual_transpilation** folder consists of the Rust files obtained after manually transpiling the gperf module along with some test files that were used for testing purposes. <br><br>
**TranspilerExecutables** folder consists of the input CPP source files along with the generated Rust files upon transpiling using both Flex-Bison as well as ANTLR versions of the auto transpiler framework. The executable of the ANTLR version (which is nothing but Cp2SRust) is present in the _ANTLRVersion_Examples_ sub-folder.<br><br> 
**Paper_Appendix** folder consists of the PDF file that contains the contents of the Appendix section in the paper - "Towards a Transpiler for C/C++ to Safer Rust". <br><br>
**Cp2SRust_Appendix** folder consists of the PDF file that contains the contents of the Appendix section in the paper - "Cp2SRust: A Transpiler for C/C++ to Safer Rust". <br><br>
**Paper_CRust_gperf_transpilation_table** folder consists of the PDF file that contains the transpilation results table consisting of the analysis of CRust's application on the gperf files.
